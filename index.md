# Nicolò Paviato

Postdoctoral Researcher  
**Weizmann Institute of Science**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, working with <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/sarigo/home" target="_blank">Prof. Omri Sarig</a>.

My research focuses on statistical properties of hyperbolic and expanding dynamical systems, with a particular emphasis on the central limit theorem and its relative functional version. More recently, I have also worked on typical behaviours of random sequences of independently drawn digits, in connection with Poisson genericity.
